# Code Review - CTIS 310 Card Game Project

## What this is:
This is a code review for the card game project with Blackjack and Lamarckian Poker.

---

# Files I Reviewed:
- Card.java  
- Deck.java  
- Hand.java  
- Blackjack.java  
- CardGameDriver.java  
- LamarckianPoker.java

---

# Card.java

- The enums for Suit and Rank are there  
- You can make a random card or a specific one  
- compareTo works fine and checks rank then suit  

Things to fix maybe:  
- The TODO in compareTo can be removed and replaced with a real summary

---

# Deck.java

- Builds the full deck, shuffles it, deals and picks cards  
- getDeck(), clear(), and size() are all there  

Suggestions:  
- deal() and pick() could crash if the deck is empty or index is out of bounds   

---

# Hand.java

- Can add, remove, reset, and get cards  
- Blackjack value is calculated right, with Aces being 11 or 1  

Minor things:  
- No index check in getCard(), which could crash the game if used wrong  
- StringBuilder in toString() might be better but not a huge deal

---

# Blackjack.java

- Follows the rules: player hits until 16, dealer until 17  
- Deals two cards to each, works fine  

What could be better:  
- Add checks in case the deck runs out of cards  
- Maybe use constantss like PLAYER_LIMIT = 16 instead of magic numbers  

---

# CardGameDriver.java

- Runs 10,000 Blackjack games and counts dealer wins, player wins, and pushes  
- Also runs a game of Lamarckian Poker  

Problems:  
- It crashes if one of the hands is empty in LamarckianPoker:  
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: bound must be positive

yaml
Copy
Edit

Fix:  
- Just add a check in turn() to make sure the hand isn’t empty before doing rand.nextInt(size)

Other suggestions:  
- Split the Blackjack and LamarckianPoker into their own driver files — having both in one is kinda messy and confuzing

---

# LamarckianPoker.java

- Does something with the card swapping, pool, discard  
- Game ends once both players have at least 7 cards  

Main issue:  
- It sometimes crashes during turn() when a hand is empty

Other notes:  
- Some repeated code in turn() could be made into a helper method  
- Magic numbers like 4 and 7 should be constants   
- Logic overall makes sense but can get a little jumbled in longer turns

---

# Summary / Final Thoughts

- The project does what the instructions asked  
- Blackjack works fine and LamarckianPoker mostly does too (except that crash)  
- Just needs some guard checks, maybe a bit more orginization  
- Splitting the two games into separate drivers would really help clean it up
